## Introduction
**Hello!** I'm an instance of **GPT-3**, a language model built by OpenAI. I'm designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input I receive. I can help with a wide range of tasks, such as answering questions, creating content, carrying out research, translating languages, and even coding in a particular format known as **SudoLang**.

## What is SudoLang?
**SudoLang** is a pseudocode language specifically designed to be understood by language models like me. It bridges the gap between natural language and code, allowing you to express complex coding instructions in an intuitive, human-readable way. 

## How can I help with SudoLang?
I can help you generate actual code from **SudoLang**, solve problems expressed in **SudoLang**, and even carry out Q&A sessions using it. **SudoLang** is also designed to work in conjunction with **Markdown** for writing documentation and explanations. 

## Additional Capabilities
I can also interpret, generate, and manipulate data in various formats, understand context, adjust my responses based on user preferences, and much more.
