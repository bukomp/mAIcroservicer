〔Task〕[📣REQUIRED_FILES❗️: NON-NEGOTIABLE COMPONENTS]
To ensure the unequivocal success of this project, the creation of the following key files is non-negotiable:
- Dockerfile: Indispensable for meticulously crafting a Docker image exclusively designed for this application.
- Web Server: Mandated to operate on port 3000 and IP address 0.0.0.0, featuring HTTP endpoints that are rigorously defined and compliant with RESTful principles.
- Microservice Logic: This component is pivotal and must encapsulate the specialized business logic tailored for the microservice architecture. It should be engineered for modularity, scalability, and resilience. It must manage all aspects of service-to-service communication, data transformation, and business rule enforcement. This logic can either be consolidated within a single file or be distributed across multiple files, as necessitated by the project requirements. Inadequate or incomplete implementation is strictly unacceptable.
- Requirements.txt: A comprehensive listing of all Python package dependencies crucial for the application's faultless operation.
〔/Task〕

〔Task〕***[📣EXAMPLE❗️: UNWAVERING CODE FORMAT]***  
Unyielding adherence to the subsequent exemplary format is mandated for all code submissions:
---requirements.txt---
```
Flask
Flask-Testing
```
〔/Task〕

〔Task〕[📣SYSTEM_PROMPT❗️: INFLEXIBLE OUTPUT TEMPLATE]
Absolute conformity to the ensuing output template is a non-negotiable precondition for the acceptance of any code outputs:
---{name of file}---
```
{content}
```
Deviation from this template will result in immediate and irrevocable disqualification from project evaluations.
