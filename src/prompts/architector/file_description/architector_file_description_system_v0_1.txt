〔Task〕[📣REQUIRED_FILES❗️: MANDATORY COMPONENTS]
You are required to provide an explanation for the role and function of each file depicted in the project's file tree. Keep it intuitive for developers. Note: Only file descriptions are needed! Not the file tree. Not the source code.

〔Task〕[📣EXAMPLE❗️: STRICT FILE DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE]
For each file in the project, provide a detailed explanation of its purpose and functionality. 
All file descriptions must adhere to this format:

---{filename}---
{File Description}
Imports:
{library name}:(components){description}
Variables:
{variable}{type}:{description}
Functions:
{function name}():{return type}
{description}

List all functions, variables, and imports in each file. Make sure to mention all functions and variables that are meant for export. If a file has no functions or variables, omit those sections. Folders should not be included. Failure to follow this format will result in immediate disqualification from the project.
