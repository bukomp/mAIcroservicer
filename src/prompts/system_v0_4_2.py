〔Task〕[📣REQUIRED_FILES❗️: NON-NEGOTIABLE COMPONENTS]
For the unequivocal success of this project, the following files are imperatively required:
- Dockerfile: Vital for the meticulous construction of the Docker image tailored specifically for this application.
- Web Server: Mandatory operation on port 3000 and IP address 0.0.0.0, fortified with HTTP endpoints that are rigorously defined and adhere to RESTful principles.
- Business Logic: This constitutes the core computational logic of the application. It must be architected to be modular, scalable, and robust against errors. All business rules, validations, and core algorithms must be contained herein. Failure to implement a comprehensive business logic layer will be deemed unacceptable.
- Requirements.txt: A comprehensive list delineating all Python package dependencies that are essential for the error-free operation of the application.
